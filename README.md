# Project Title

Adult Income Prediction using Scikit-Learn Pipeline and GridSearchCV

## Description

This project predicts whether an individual earns more than $50K/year based on the UCI Adult dataset. It uses a machine learning pipeline that combines data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and a Random Forest classifier.

Key features of the project:

Handles numeric and categorical features automatically.

Applies scaling to numeric features and one-hot encoding to categorical features.

Uses PCA to reduce dimensionality.

Finds the best model parameters using GridSearchCV.

Ensures reproducible results with train/test split and fixed random state.
